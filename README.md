## Installation 

Use Raspberry Pi Imager to install on the microSD the Raspbian OS with preinstalled Octoprint

Ssh into the Raspberry Pi, if you kept the default settings you just will   
``` ssh octoprint@octopi.local ```

To install everything via install.sh download the folder and ``` cd ``` into it:   
``` cd /home/pi/raspberry-remote-shutdown ``` 

Install desktop environment to use VNC  
`sudo /home/octoprint/scripts/install-desktop `

Install vnc  
` sudo apt install realvnc-vnc-server realvnc-vnc-viewer `

Set Desktop gui to boot at startup and set the resolution at least at 1280 x 720   
` sudo raspi-config `

Install Chromium   
`sudo apt-get install chromium-browser --yes `

Make the script executable:   
``` chmod +x install.sh ```   

Run the script:    
``` sudo ./install.sh ```   

## Testing MQTT

From terminal send MQTT messages to the broker which sends them to ESPHome client.    

To turn on:   
``` mosquitto_pub -d -t ender/switch/mains/command -m "on" ```   

To turn off:   
``` mosquitto_pub -d -t ender/switch/mains/command -m "off" ```   

To turn off after 30 seconds delay:
